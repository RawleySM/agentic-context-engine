## Quick Start (~5 minutes)

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install ace-framework
```

### 2. Set Your API Key

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
# Or use Claude, Gemini, or 100+ other providers
```

### 3. Create Your First ACE Agent

```python
from ace import ACE, LiteLLMClient

# Initialize with any LLM
client = LiteLLMClient(model="gpt-4o-mini")
ace = ACE(client)

# Teach your agent (it learns from examples)
ace.learn([
    {"question": "What is 2+2?", "answer": "4"},
    {"question": "What is 5*3?", "answer": "15"}
])

# Now it can solve new problems
result = ace.answer("What is 7*8?")
print(result)  # Agent applies learned strategies
```

That's it! Your agent is now learning and improving. üéâ

## What is ACE Framework?

**Think of it as giving your AI agents a living notebook where they write down lessons learned and apply them to future tasks.**
ACE (Agentic Context Engineering) framework makes your AI agents smarter over time. Unlike traditional prompting, ACE agents build a "playbook" of strategies that evolve based on experience - learning what works, what doesn't, and continuously improving.

### Clear Benefits
- üß† **Self-Improving**: Agents get smarter with each task
- üìà **20-35% Better Performance**: Proven improvements on complex tasks
- üîÑ **No Context Collapse**: Preserves valuable knowledge over time
- üöÄ **100+ LLM Providers**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more

### Core Concepts

ACE uses three specialized roles that work together:

1. **üéØ Generator** - Produces answers using the playbook
2. **üîç Reflector** - Analyzes what worked and what didn't
3. **üìù Curator** - Updates the playbook with new strategies

The magic happens in the **Playbook** - a living document of strategies that evolves with experience.
ACE prevents "context collapse" through incremental updates rather than full rewrites, preserving valuable strategies over time.

## Installation Options

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install ace-framework

# With LangChain support
pip install ace-framework[langchain]

# With all features
pip install ace-framework[all]

# Development
pip install ace-framework[dev]
```

## Configuration

ACE works with any LLM provider through LiteLLM:

```python
# OpenAI
client = LiteLLMClient(model="gpt-4o")

# Anthropic Claude
client = LiteLLMClient(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")

# Google Gemini
client = LiteLLMClient(model="gemini-pro")

# Ollama (local)
client = LiteLLMClient(model="ollama/llama2")

# With fallbacks for reliability
client = LiteLLMClient(
    model="gpt-4",
    fallbacks=["claude-3-haiku", "gpt-3.5-turbo"]
)
```

## Demos

### Basic Q&A Agent

```python
from ace import OfflineAdapter, Generator, Reflector, Curator
from ace import LiteLLMClient, SimpleEnvironment

# Setup components
client = LiteLLMClient(model="gpt-4o-mini")
generator = Generator(client)
reflector = Reflector(client)
curator = Curator(client)

# Create and train an adapter
adapter = OfflineAdapter(generator, reflector, curator)
environment = SimpleEnvironment()

# Train on examples
training_samples = [
    {"question": "What's the capital of France?", "answer": "Paris"},
    {"question": "What's 2+2?", "answer": "4"}
]

results = adapter.run(training_samples, environment, epochs=2)

# Save the learned strategies
adapter.playbook.save_to_file("my_agent.json")
```

### Online Learning (Learn While Running)

```python
from ace import OnlineAdapter

# Agent improves while processing real tasks
adapter = OnlineAdapter(
    playbook=existing_playbook,
    generator=generator,
    reflector=reflector,
    curator=curator
)

# Process tasks one by one, learning from each
for task in real_world_tasks:
    result = adapter.process(task, environment)
    # Agent automatically updates its strategies
```
